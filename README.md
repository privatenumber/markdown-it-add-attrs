# markdown-it-add-attrs

> [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugin to add attributes to all rendered elements

I made this so I can easily add and scope a [markdown stylesheet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) without interfering with some of the other code in the markdown.
